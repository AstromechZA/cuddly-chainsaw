This is my repository of OverTheWire.org passwords and my own code as I reach solutions.

I only started saving my code halfway through Natas as the levels before that were easy enough.

## If you've reached this repo while searching for solutions please don't use them.

You'll be ruining your own experience if you just copy other peoples solutions.
